# Plankton-Simulator
Plankton Simulator is C++ game made using Raylib, It was made for GitHub Game Off 2021.
Plankton Simulator was made under time of 1 month.
As it is my first C++ project, so the source code is surely not clean.

### Background of The Plankton Simulator
This Game is basically about a zoo-plankton, who is in search of some phytho-planktons to feed upon.
But zoo-planktons are not at the top of marine food-chain, which means someone else is also in search of feed upon.
You can also speed yourself up, to prevent being eaten, but be careful sprint time is limited, you need to eat to get that back.

### Compile

At first you need to install Raylib from [here]("https://github.com/raysan5/raylib") and compile it by executing ``make`` command in ``raylib/src/`` directory.

Then make a directory named ``/include`` and Add the ``raylib.h`` file in that directory of this repository, and do the same for ``library.a`` in directory named ``lib``.

And execute the ``make`` command in the ``/build`` directory.
